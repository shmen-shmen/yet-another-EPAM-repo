The basil is arranged with the amber glass
And the eggs, all in perfection
We hold this table it is cold, we hold this mass
Far away from town, a mirror, no reflection

U think u know north-east but we know better
We know the silence, we know the dark
U know the address so u sent that letter
U put ur sympathies, u made ur mark

But u have never been here and u never will
Here where life is still, where we hold tables
The wine is in our glasses now, we take our pills
Now we can look at it, now we are able

We stir the water up, we place it in the front
Then lay our pencils down, sticks within reach
What we wrote on the wall and in our favorite font
Is now to be read up, these words we preach

Grow let it grow in our still life scape
Take what it needs to fullfill
So it will be that we keep these drapes
Let it forever be still

Oh let it show what we did today
How its been passed from our hands
Its in the traces of where we lay
Right here as long as it stands

Theres a freezer in this kitchen but no ice inside
Its a place to hide, whenever needed
We will stay and face the windows we don't need a ride
All is here tonite, all what we did

The sleeping grass we planted growing slowly
In bowls arranged and numbered up in line
To look and never ever touch the holy
To sit and keep the focus on the shrine

Grow let it grow in our still life scape
Take what it needs to fullfill
So it will be that we keep these drapes
Let it forever be still

Oh let it show what we did today
How its been passed from our hands
Its in the traces of where we lay
Right here as long as it stands
